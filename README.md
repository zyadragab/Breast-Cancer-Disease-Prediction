# Breast Cancer Disease Prediction ðŸ©º

This project is part of my CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Predict whether a breast tumor is *malignant (cancerous)* or *benign (non-cancerous)* using patient data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer
- 569 samples, 30 features

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Models were evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Final comparison shows performance across all algorithms.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
